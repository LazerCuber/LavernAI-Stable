## LavernAI is heavily based on [TavernAI](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI )
- Some UI and performance optimizations
- Focuses on the CAI ui design (So don't expect I work on other designs)
- Fix Tavern designs and css bugs
- 1.6 coming soon

I'll put more stuff and features on the test version (soon)
Note: this is still using charaCloud as a character storing database so if the database is down, Lavern is also down lol
